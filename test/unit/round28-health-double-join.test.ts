/**
 * BUG A (pts/2 hang investigation 2026-06-16): double-joined health path.
 *
 * stateRoot = `<crewRoot>/state/runs/<runId>`. The crew root is THREE dirnames
 * up, but team-runner computed only TWO → got `<crewRoot>/state` (the state
 * dir). HealthStore then joined HEALTH_DIR (`.crew/state/health`) onto it →
 * `<crewRoot>/state/.crew/state/health` — a bogus double-joined path. Health
 * snapshots were silently written to a nonexistent subtree (breaking the
 * feature) AND created junk dirs the recursive state watcher attached extra
 * inotify watches to.
 *
 * Fix: crewRoot = 3 dirnames up; HEALTH_DIR = "state/health" (relative to crew root).
