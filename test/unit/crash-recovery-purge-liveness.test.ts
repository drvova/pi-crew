/**
 * Regression tests for the "team run hangs forever at 25%" bug.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE: `purgeStaleActiveRunIndex` (crash-recovery.ts) deleted a run's
 * stateRoot based on `entry.updatedAt`, which is frozen at registration and
 * NEVER refreshed during execution. A long-running legitimate async run whose
 * background worker had exited (e.g. after a 5–15 minute explorer) would then
 * have its entire durable state (manifest/tasks/events/heartbeat) destroyed.
 * Because `saveRunTasks()` silently no-ops once the state dir is missing, the
 * workflow could never advance past the current task → permanent INVISIBLE
 * hang ("Run not found"), with all diagnostics lost. This reproduced across
 * 4+ consecutive review/fast-fix runs.
 *
 * FIX: purge now corroborates liveness via (a) the on-disk `manifest.updatedAt`
 * and (b) the team-level `heartbeat.json`, and no longer deletes stateRoot —
 * it marks the run cancelled so it stays queryable/resumable and its
 * diagnostics survive (the finished-run pruner cleans the dir later).
 *
 * Testing strategy: we register each run with an ALIVE worker PID (so the
 * registry's own registration liveness filter accepts it — mirroring reality,
 * where the PID is alive at registration), then kill+reap the worker so the PID
 * is genuinely dead at purge time. We advance purge's `now` to simulate the
 * entry aging past the threshold, and use `fs.utimesSync` to place the heartbeat
 * mtime precisely in simulated time.
