/**
 * Fix C — honest markers for chain-history bounding (was the only silent-loss path).
 *
 * `ChainRunner.enrichContextFromHandoffs` bounds memory by dropping: (a) handoffs
 * older than the last 100, (b) any single handoff whose JSON exceeds 5000 bytes,
 * (c) array fields past their caps (50 files, 20 decisions/nextSteps). Previously
 * all of these vanished with NO marker. Now a `__chainHistoryNotes` sibling field
 * records what was elided so a reader knows context is incomplete.
 *
 * The upstream result artifacts stay intact on disk; this only makes the injected
 * `__chainHistory` context honest.
 *
 * @see src/runtime/chain-runner.ts enrichContextFromHandoffs
 * @see research-findings/output-handling-deep-dive.md §F
