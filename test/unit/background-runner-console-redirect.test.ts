/**
 * Regression test for the "team run hangs forever at 25%" Bug Y.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE: src/runtime/background-runner.ts redirected only `console.log`
 * and `console.error` to the log file. `console.debug` and `console.warn`
 * still wrote to the original stdout/stderr pipe — which is CLOSED once the
 * parent process detaches (the bg-runner is spawned with `detached:true` +
 * `setsid:true`, so its parent disconnects the stdio pipes). The very next
 * `console.debug` call from team-runner.ts:323 (inside
 * `mergeTaskUpdatesPreservingTerminal`) hit the closed stdout → unhandled
 * `EPIPE` error → process exit → scheduler dead → run stuck at 25% forever.
 *
 * Fix: extend the in-process console redirect to also cover `console.debug`
 * and `console.warn`, AND wrap the `fs.writeSync` in try-catch so any log-write
 * failure (closed fd, ENOSPC, etc.) can never crash the scheduler.
 *
 * This test verifies the fix PATTERN (the redirect + try-catch wrapper) is
 * robust. We replicate the `origWrite` logic from background-runner.ts here
 * (the function is module-local and intentionally not exported), and assert
 * it never throws — which is the property that prevents the EPIPE crash.
