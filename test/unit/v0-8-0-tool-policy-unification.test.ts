/**
 * v0.8.0 — tool-restriction unification tests.
 *
 * Bug: the child-pi path (`pi-args.ts`) and live-session path
 * (`live-session-runtime.ts`) disagreed on tool restrictions:
 *   - child-pi: `roleConfig.tools ?? agent.tools`, `excludeTools = roleConfig.excludeTools`
 *     (role authoritative; frontmatter `tools:`/`disallowed_tools:` ignored)
 *   - live-session: `agent.tools` / `agent.disallowedTools` only
 *     (frontmatter authoritative; role-config ignored)
 * so the same agent behaved differently depending on the runtime.
 *
 * Fix: a shared `resolveToolPolicy(agent, role)` is now the single source of
 * truth used by BOTH paths. Semantics:
 *   - allowlist precedence is source-aware:
 *     builtin → role authoritative (security); user/project → frontmatter authoritative
 *   - denylist is additive: role excludeTools + agent disallowedTools merged
 *
 * These tests pin the policy resolver so both paths stay in lockstep.
