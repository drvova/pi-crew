/**
 * Unit tests for buildGoalTeam (goal-loop-runner.ts).
 *
 * Regression: previously the synthetic team's role list was `[{name:"worker",
 * agent:workerAgent}]`. The adaptive planner in implementation workflows
 * emits plans with role names matching the agent config (e.g. "executor").
 * `parseAdaptivePlan` rejected every plan because role "executor" was not
 * in allowedRoles=["worker"]. As a result goal-wrapped implementation
 * workflows ran only the assess task and never executed the planned
 * executor/verifier tasks.
 *
 * Fix: use workerAgent as the role NAME so adaptive plans with matching
 * role names are accepted.
