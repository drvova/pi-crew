/**
 * Round 24 (BUG 1): re-entrant event-log lock deadlock regression.
 *
 * appendEventInsideLock runs INSIDE withEventLogLockSync. It used to call the
 * PUBLIC compactEventLog/rotateEventLog, which themselves acquire the SAME
 * mkdir lock. The mkdir lock is NOT re-entrant (same-PID owner is never
 * treated as stale), so the inner acquire spun to the 5s timeout, threw
 * eventLogLockTimeout, and was silently caught — meaning compaction/rotation
 * NEVER ran from the sync append path → unbounded log growth → events
 * silently dropped past 50MB.
 *
 * Fix: split compactEventLog/rotateEventLog into prepare + apply(+rotate)
 * unlocked cores; appendEventInsideLock calls the unlocked cores directly.
 *
 * This test verifies:
 *  (a) compaction runs to completion when invoked inside the lock (no timeout);
 *  (b) the unlocked apply path actually compacts;
 *  (c) the public locked variants still work standalone.
