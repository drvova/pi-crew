/**
 * Tests for src/runtime/crew-hooks.ts
 * Coverage:
 * - register / unregister lifecycle
 * - emit fires registered hooks
 * - emit with no hooks is a no-op
 * - synchronous hook error does not block other hooks
 * - async hook rejection is caught (not unhandled)
 * - duplicate registration is idempotent
 * - unregister of non-existent hook is a no-op
