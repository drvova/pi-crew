/**
 * Round 26 lock-correctness fixes (BUG 1/2 in locks.ts):
 *
 * BUG 1: acquireLockWithRetry did two separate readFileSync calls
 *   (isLockStale + isLockHolderAlive). Between them the lock could transition
 *   stale→fresh, and we'd forcibly rm a NEW holder's freshly-acquired lock.
 *   Fix: readLockSnapshot() does a single stat+read for both checks.
 *
 * BUG 2: withFileLockSync had a pre-acquisition cleanup that stat'd the TARGET
 *   file and deleted the .lock if the target was missing. This was racy
 *   (concurrent holder creating the target) and actively wrong for callers
 *   passing a path already ending in .lock (config.ts). Fix: removed entirely;
 *   acquireLockWithRetry's staleMs-based steal handles genuine orphans.
