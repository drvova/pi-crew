/**
 * Regression test for HB-003a: ctx.agent({disableTools:true, maxTurns:1}) → exit null.
 *
 * Root cause (Phase-0): when maxTurns was reached on a turn_end event, the steer-
 * injection code treated a normal Node backpressure `stdin.write() === false` as a
 * fatal failure and called `killProcessTree(child.pid, child)` → SIGTERM. The worker
 * was killed mid-answer even though stdout already contained a valid answer.
 *
 * Phase-1 fix: steer injection is ADVISORY. On `write() === false` (backpressure)
 * OR a non-writable stdin, we log + let the hard-abort at maxTurns + graceTurns
 * handle genuinely runaway workers. No `killProcessTree` on the steer path.
 *
 * This test has two parts:
 *   1. Source-contract check: the steer-backpressure and steer-not-writable branches
 *      must NOT contain a `killProcessTree(` call. (Cheap, deterministic, catches
 *      regressions even without a real pi binary.)
 *   2. Real-binary smoke check (opt-in via PI_CREW_SMOKE=1): spawn a real pi with
 *      maxTurns:1 + disableTools and assert exit=0 + answer present, run 5×. Skipped
 *      in normal CI to avoid token cost.
