/**
 * HB-002 Windows test: EBUSY rename retry (round-10 / atomic-write).
 *
 * Windows returns EBUSY/EPERM/ENOTEMPTY during `fs.renameSync` far more often
 * than Unix (antivirus, file indexer, SMB). `renameWithRetry` exists exactly
 * for this. On Unix the retry path is rarely exercised, so this test
 * self-skips off Windows — its assertions are only meaningful there.
 *
 * v0.9.3 lesson: a macOS-only grep difference passed Linux CI and was caught
 * only at publish time. The same risk applies here in reverse — Windows-only
 * retry behavior must be verified on Windows.
