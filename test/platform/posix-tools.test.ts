/**
 * HB-002 POSIX test: BSD-vs-GNU tooling differences.
 *
 * The v0.9.3 incident: a CI step worked on Linux (GNU grep) but failed on
 * macOS (BSD grep) because of a `--help` exit-code / flag difference. This
 * test documents the POSIX-vs-GNU split and verifies the pi-crew code paths
 * that shell out do NOT depend on GNU-only behavior. It runs on macOS AND
 * Linux (both are "POSIX-ish"), but the assertions are tuned to catch the
 * kind of difference that bit v0.9.3.
 *
 * Self-skips on Windows (different toolchain entirely — PowerShell/cmd).
