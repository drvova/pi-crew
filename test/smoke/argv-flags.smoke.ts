/**
 * HB-004 smoke #1: argv flags the real `pi` binary accepts.
 *
 * Regression guard for the `--crew-subagent` bug (commit c55d3e2): an earlier
 * process-safety fix prepended an unknown flag to argv, and pi's strict option
 * parser exited non-zero on every ctx.agent() call. The unit suite missed it
 * because it never invokes the real binary.
 *
 * This test does NOT spawn a full agent (token cost). It runs `pi --version`
 * with each argv flag buildPiWorkerArgs emits appended, and asserts pi does
 * not reject the flag. (pi --version exits early before flag-dependent work,
 * so unknown flags surface as "Error: Unknown option".)
 *
 * NOTE: pi --version with extra args may or may not validate args before
 * printing version. If it doesn't validate, this test degrades to a baseline
 * "pi runs" check. The authoritative guard is test #2-4 which run real agents.
