/**
 * Shared helpers for smoke tests (HB-004).
 *
 * Smoke tests shell out to the REAL `pi` binary (not mocked). They are gated
 * behind PI_CREW_SMOKE=1 so CI doesn't bill tokens by default — run manually:
 *
 *   PI_CREW_SMOKE=1 npm run test:smoke
 *   PI_CREW_SMOKE=1 npx tsx --test test/smoke/agent-disabletools.smoke.ts
 *
 * Why these exist: the unit suite mocks child-pi, so it cannot catch bugs that
 * only manifest against the real binary (argv rejection, persona interactions,
 * spawn-lifecycle races). See HB-003a in docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md for the
 * incident that motivated this harness.
