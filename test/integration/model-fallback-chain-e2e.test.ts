/**
 * FIX 4 E2E — exercise the full model-fallback chain end to end.
 *
 * Setup:
 *   - Use a direct-agent run (single task) so the global mock counter
 *     maps 1:1 to attempts on that task.
 *   - Inject a model registry with 2 models so buildConfiguredModelRouting
 *     produces exactly 2 candidates (the registry fallback chain — agent
 *     frontmatter has no explicit `model`/`fallbackModels`).
 *   - Force `model: "x"` (non-existent in any registry) — gets filtered
 *     out by isAvailableModel, leaving the registry candidates.
 *   - Mock = `retryable-failure-then-success`: invocation #1 returns a
 *     silent retryable failure (exit 0, message_end with errorMessage
 *     matching `/provider[_ ]?error/i`, no real text); invocation #2+
 *     returns the standard json-success transcript.
 *
 * Expected outcome:
 *   - attempt #1 fails with retryable-pattern error → task-runner pushes
 *     failed ModelAttemptState and routes to candidate #2.
 *   - attempt #2 succeeds → task completes.
 *   - modelAttempts.length === 2 with [0].success === false, [1].success
 *     === true.
