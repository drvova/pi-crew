/**
 * Resolve a target path to its real (symlink-resolved) absolute path while
 * guaranteeing the result stays inside `baseDir`.
 *
 * ## Security model — asymmetric ancestor handling
 *
 * `baseDir` and `targetPath` are validated with different policies because
 * they play different roles:
 *
 * - **baseDir** (the container): all ancestors MUST exist and MUST NOT be
 *   symlinks. We refuse to operate if any component is missing or symlinked,
 *   because a symlinked container could point the caller outside the
 *   intended trust boundary (e.g. `/var/run -> /run` resolving into an
 *   attacker-controlled directory).
 *
 * - **targetPath** (the contained file): the FINAL component may be
 *   non-existent (for write operations creating a new file) and EXISTING
 *   ancestors of the target may also be missing. We DO require that any
 *   ancestor that DOES exist must not be a symlink — an attacker who can
 *   create a directory in the container must not be able to redirect the
 *   file being created.
 *
 * This asymmetry is intentional: callers that need to create a new file
 * pass a non-existent targetPath. Callers that operate on an existing file
 * get full symlink protection. Callers MUST NOT pass a symlinked
 * intermediate component; if you need to, use `resolveContainedPath`
 * instead (which only checks the resolved path, not the chain).
 *
 * Throws on:
 *   - null byte in targetPath
 *   - targetPath resolves outside baseDir
 *   - any existing ancestor (base or target) is a symlink
 *   - baseDir itself does not exist
 *
 * Returns the resolved real path on success, or the resolved (but not
 * realpathed) path when the target does not exist yet.
 *
 * NOTE: There is a race condition window between validation and use where an
 * attacker could create a directory component after validation but before the
 * file is created. Callers MUST create parent directories atomically
 * (e.g., mkdirSync with { recursive: true }) and use O_CREAT | O_NOFOLLOW | O_EXCL
 * for atomic file creation, as atomicWriteFile does. This ensures the entire
 * operation is atomic and prevents TOCTOU attacks.
