 * run-not-found.ts — Centralized "Run not found" error helper (DX: F2).
 *
 * Round 16 DX audit found that a stale/typo'd runId hits a blank
 * "Run '<id>' not found." wall in 8+ handlers (status, resume, steer, export,
 * forget, cleanup, invalidate, worktrees, events, artifacts). The run IDs are
 * long (`team_20260615173318_b9c8fe49a74e0760`), so typos/truncation are
 * near-certain for new users — yet `team list` (which shows recent runs) is
 * never suggested.
 *
 * This module centralizes the message + recovery hint so every handler stays
 * consistent and the hint never drifts.
