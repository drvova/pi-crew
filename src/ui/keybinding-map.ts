/**
 * Dashboard keybinding map (L2 refactor: data-driven dispatch).
 *
 * Before L2 this module exposed `DASHBOARD_KEYS` (a data table) but dispatched
 * via a 30-line `if (includes(...)) return "..."` chain — adding a key meant
 * editing BOTH the table AND the dispatch, a DRY violation. L2 collapses the
 * dispatch into a single `for (const b of BINDINGS)` loop driven by the
 * `BINDINGS` table below. `DASHBOARD_KEYS` is retained as the raw key data so
 * existing imports and the dead-but-intentional `KEY_RESERVED` set keep working.
 *
 * Recalibration vs. the original L2 plan: the plan also called for an
 * `inTextInput` guard to prevent letter-key leaks into TUI text inputs.
 * Verified during implementation that this is NOT needed — overlays are
 * mutually exclusive and each has its own `handleInput`. `mailbox-compose-overlay.ts:111`
 * captures every single-char key via `appendText(data)` and never delegates to
 * `dashboardActionForKey`, so there is no leak path. Adding the guard would
 * complicate the API (`run-dashboard.ts:485` has no text-input state to pass)
 * for zero benefit. The input-guard half of L2 is therefore intentionally
 * skipped; only the DRY/data-driven dispatch refactor landed.
 *
 * Origin pattern: deer-flow `frontend/src/components/workspace/command-palette.tsx:39-50`
 * drives shortcuts from a single data array consumed by one loop in
 * `use-global-shortcuts.ts:38-61`.

/**
 * The dispatch table. ORDER MATTERS — first match wins.
 *
 * Precedence notes (must match the pre-L2 if-chain exactly):
 *   1. `close` always wins (q / Esc).
 *   2. `mailbox-detail` (\r, \n) is pane-scoped to mailbox and MUST precede
 *      `select` (which also binds \r, \n) so Enter opens the detail instead of
 *      triggering select while in the mailbox pane.
 *   3. `health-*` are pane-scoped to health.
 *   4. `notifications-dismiss` (H) is global.
 *   5. `select`, then the root actions, pane switches, and navigation.
 *
 * NOTE: mailbox action keys A/N/C/P/X (ack/nudge/compose/preview/ackAll) are
 * intentionally NOT in this table. They live in `DASHBOARD_KEYS.mailbox` for
 * reservation but are handled by the mailbox overlay's own `handleInput`,
 * not by the dashboard dispatch. Adding them here would change behavior.
