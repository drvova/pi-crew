/**
 * Persist a single task update using compare-and-swap under the run lock.
 *
 * Problem: The naive read-merge-write pattern is vulnerable to a read-modify-write
 * race. When two parallel task completions race:
 *   1. Task A loads tasks [A(running), B(running)], writes [A(completed), B(running)]
 *   2. Task B loads [A(running), B(running)] (stale, before A's write), writes [A(running), B(completed)]
 *   Result: Task A's completed status is clobbered.
 *
 * Solution: Use mtime-based CAS under the run lock. Before writing, stat the tasks file
 * to record its mtime. After merging, re-stat — if mtime changed, another writer
 * committed first; retry with the fresh state. This is O(retry) under contention but
 * converges in the normal single-writer case.
 *
 * @param checkpointPhase - Optional checkpoint phase to include in the task state alongside the update.
