/**
 * Verification Integrity — manifest bookend snapshot helper (RFC §P1a).
 *
 * Hashes a FIXED set of project-manifest files so the goal loop can detect
 * drift between T_snap (before verification runs) and T_verify_done (after the
 * command exits). This closes the PERSISTENT-edit subcase of workspace
 * tampering (a worker that rewrites package.json / lockfile and leaves it
 * changed). See RFC §P1a / §6 STRIDE for the full threat model.
 *
 * RESIDUALS (documented; closed by Phase 1.5 git-worktree sandbox, NOT here):
 *  - Round-trip tamper: a worker can edit a manifest, run the test, then REVERT
 *    before T_verify_done so the hash matches T_snap. Content-addressed
 *    execution (git-worktree) is required to close this. Not fixable by hashing.
 *  - Invoked-script tampering: only the manifest files in MANIFEST_FILES are
 *    hashed. A worker that overwrites a script the verification command invokes
 *    is NOT caught. Phase 1.5 git-worktree closes this.
 *  - node_modules/ and transitive deps are deliberately NOT hashed (size +
 *    churn); package-lock.json IS hashed, which transitively pins resolved
 *    dependency versions.
 *
 * Pure leaf module: depends only on node: built-ins. Does NOT import
 * goal-loop-runner or goal-evaluator (keeps the P1a helper unit-testable in
 * isolation and avoids pulling the conflict-zone modules into this file).
