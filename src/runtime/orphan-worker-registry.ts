/**
 * Orphan background-worker registry.
 *
 * Tracks PIDs of background-runner.ts processes spawned via async-runner.
 * Workers are detached, setsid'd, and unref'd, so they outlive the spawning
 * pi session. If the parent pi process is killed (SIGKILL, crash), workers
 * become orphans and keep running forever.
 *
 * This registry provides:
 *   1. `registerWorker` — called from async-runner.ts after successful spawn.
 *   2. `unregisterWorker` — called when a worker exits (via async-marker
 *      or heartbeat watcher).
 *   3. `cleanupOrphanWorkers` — called on session_start; kills workers whose
 *      registration is older than STALE_REGISTRATION_MS (default 1h) and
 *      removes dead PIDs from the registry.
 *
 * Persistence: file-based JSON in `<userPiRoot>/state/orphan-workers.json`.
 * File is rewritten on every operation to drop dead PIDs.
