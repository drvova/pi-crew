Skill paths passed to child Pi: 2

# Applicable Skills
The following skills were selected for this worker. Follow them when they match the current task. If a selected skill conflicts with the explicit task packet, project AGENTS.md, or user request, follow the stricter/higher-priority instruction and report the conflict.

## delegation-patterns
Description: Subagent/team delegation workflow. Use when splitting work across pi-crew teams, direct agents, async background workers, chains, or parallel research/review tasks.
Source: project:skills/delegation-patterns

# delegation-patterns

Use this skill when deciding how to delegate work.

## Source patterns distilled

- pi-subagents: foreground/background/parallel/chain execution, fork/fresh context, worktree isolation, result watcher
- pi-crew: `src/extension/team-tool/run.ts`, `src/runtime/team-runner.ts`, `src/runtime/task-graph-scheduler.ts`, builtin `teams/*.team.md`, `workflows/*.workflow.md`
- Existing pi-crew skill: `task-packet`

## Rules

- Delegate when tasks span multiple files/subsystems, need planning/review/verification, or can be independently researched.
- Do not parallelize edits to the same file, symbol, migration path, manifest/lockfile, or generated schema unless explicitly sequenced.
- Use read-only explorer/reviewer roles for source audit; implementation workers should receive narrow task packets.
- For async/background work, provide concrete objective, scope, constraints, outputs, and verification. Do not spin in wait loops; retrieve results when notified or when needed.
- For chain-style work, pass dependency outputs forward explicitly and require downstream workers to read upstream artifacts first.
- Use worktree isolation for risky parallel code-changing tasks when repository cleanliness and merge plan allow it.
- Require workers to report blockers and smallest recoverable next action rather than making broad assumptions.

## Task packet checklist

- objective
- scope/paths
- allowed edits vs read-only areas
- constraint

## requirements-to-task-packet
Description: Use when a goal, issue, roadmap item, review finding, or user request must become actionable worker tasks.
Source: project:skills/requirements-to-task-packet

# requirements-to-task-packet

Core principle: workers need explicit task packets, not inherited ambiguity. Ask only when ambiguity changes architecture, safety, public behavior, or data loss risk; otherwise record assumptions.

Distilled from detailed reads of clarification, spec-to-implementation, subagent-driven development, and skill-authoring patterns.

## Clarify or Proceed

Ask before implementation when ambiguity affects:

- security boundary, permissions, ownership, or secret handling;
- destructive operations, migrations, publishing, or public API behavior;
- architecture or data model;
- acceptance criteria or rollback expectations.

Proceed with explicit assumptions when ambiguity is local, reversible, and testable.

## Subagent Context Rules

- Give each worker fresh, curated context; do not rely on hidden parent history.
- Include exact upstream artifact paths and summaries when needed.
- Keep implementation tasks independent or explicitly sequenced.
- Require workers to report one of: DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED.
- For BLOCKED/NEEDS_CONTEXT, change context/model/scope before retrying.

## Acceptance Criteria

Use observable checks:
